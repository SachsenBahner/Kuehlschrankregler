# Kuehlschrankregler
Fixed a broken refrigerator control with an arduino nano.

- reused old analog thermometer, works as an voltage divider. The higher the value, the cooler the fridge
- compressor is controlled with an simple relais (that is inverting)
- check every 60 seconds for the temperature
